# w_scan_cpp-binaries

This is the collection of w_scan_cpp binaries.


Those binaries may or may not work for you. They have been either created by me,
or, have been contributed by others.

Some of those binaries rely on librepfunc on your system.
You may - or may not - need to install this lib too; depending on who build the binary,
how the binary was build, which version of w_scan_cpp is packaged.

If want to show up your w_scan_cpp binary here, contact me.




some hints:
* w_scan_cpp-YYYYMMDD-binary-SYSTEM.tar.bz2
  - SYSTEM == x86_64 : AMD/INTEL x86 64bit
  - SYSTEM == aarch64: 64bit embedded ARM System, for RPi-3B/3B+/4/400/CM3/CM3+/CM4/Zero2W
  - SYSTEM == armv7l: 32bit embedded ARM System, (runs on any RPi)
* .deb debian package, name gives further info, like bullseye or buster
* the date YYYYMMDD may/may not reflect the *build date* instead of the *packaged w_scan_cpp version*.
  If so, it is expected that this is the latest git version for this date, instead of a released one.
* There may/may not be a dependency on librepfunc. Build it, or get a binary separately.

Examples:
* w_scan_cpp-20210218-1_amd64.deb
  - generic Debian dpkg Package build #1, 64bit x86, w_scan_cpp-20210218
* w_scan_cpp-20210331-1bullseye_amd64.deb
  - Debian bullseye dpkg Package build #1, 64bit x86, w_scan_cpp-20210331
* w_scan_cpp-20220119-binary-aarch64.tar.bz2
  - bz2 compressed tarball, 64bit embedded System for RPi-3B/3B+/4/400/CM3/CM3+/CM4/Zero2W
