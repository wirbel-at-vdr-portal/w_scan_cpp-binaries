# w_scan_cpp-binaries

This is the collection of w_scan_cpp binaries.


Those binaries may or may not work for you. They have been either created by me,
or, have been contributed by others.

Some of those binaries rely on librepfunc on your system.
You may - or may not - need to install this lib too; depending on who build the binary,
how the binary was build, which version of w_scan_cpp is packaged.

If want to show up your w_scan_cpp binary here, contact me.
